My name is Dhruv Shrivastava and this is my cozy corner on the Internet. I am an aspiring software engineer, currently interning at a investment bank based out of Mumbai. I grew up in Delhi and then later moved to Pune to pursue my undergraduate engineering degree in Electronics and Telecommunication (B.Tech) from Symbiosis Institute of Technology. As a developer, I work with Python, Java, C and frameworks like Spring and Django. I am always looking to learn as I'm interested in backend systems, distributed systems and machine learning.One of my major pursuits is to build things, transform ideas into useful products and solve complex, real-world problems
